1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' as the first word.
2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' as the first word.
3,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,"Accession number begin with two letters followed by six or fewer digits. If the study didn't provide the accession number, the answer should be ""Not reported"" and the relevant sentences could be blank."
4,Which HIV species were studied in the paper?,Select from the following options and begin your answer with this: HIV-1; HIV-2; Other; Not reported
5,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Select one or many of the following options and begin your answer with this: Protease, PR; Reverse transcriptase, RT; Integrase, IN; Capsid, CA; Envelope; Full genome; Near full length genome. The Gag gene contains Capsid gene. The pol gene contains protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase."
6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Try your best to get countries from abstract, method, or result section. If no sequenced samples were used in this research paper, you should return 'Not Found'."
7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Reply with a list of year(s) or range only. If no sequenced samples were used in this research paper, you should return 'Not Found'."
8,What method was used for sequencing?,"Sequencing is performed using two main types of methods. Sanger (aka dideoxyterminator or dideoxynucleotide) sequencing was the only method used prior to 2007. Companies involved in Sanger sequencing included ABI (ViroSeq) and Visible Genetics (TruGene). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is being increasingly used but is still less common than Sanger sequencing. The main NGS methods involve using Illumina, Nanopore, Ion Torrent, and PacBio. Genotypic resistance testing refers to sequencing of the genes that are the targets of ART. This usually refers to the RT, protease, and integrase genes. Select from the following options and begin your answer with this: Sanger sequencing; Illumina sequencing; PacBio sequencing; Oxford Nanopore sequencing; Unknown; Other"
9,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' as the first word. If the information is not mentioned in the provided paper, then the answer is 'No'"
10,Did samples undergo single genome sequencing?,"Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' as the first word. If not mentioned in paper, then the answer is 'No'"
11,What clinical specimens were sequenced?,Select from the following options and begin your answer with this: Plasma; PBMC; Whole Blood; Serum; Other; Unknown
12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' as the first word.
13,Were any sequences obtained from the proviral DNA reservoir?,Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' or 'Unknown' as the first word.
14,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' as the first word.
15,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Please begin your answer with the number of individuals as an integer.
16,"Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs? ",Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No' or 'Unknown' as the first word.
17,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Choose one or multiple of the following combinations that appears and begin your answer with a list: NRTI (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor), including Abacavir (ABC), Zidovudine'(AZT), Zalcitabine (DDC), Didanosine (DDI), Lamivudine (3TC), Stavudine (D4T), Emtricitabine(FTC), Tenofovir (TFV); NNRTI (Non-Nucleosid Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor), including Nevirapine (NVP), Delavirdine (DLV), Efavirenz (EFV), Etravirine (ETR), Rilpivirine (RPV), Doravirine (DOR); PI (Protease Inhibitor), including  Amprenavir (APV), Lopinavir'(LPV), Atazanavir (ATV), Derunavir (DRV), Nelfinavir (NFV); INSTI (Integrase Inhibitor), including  Raltegravir (RAL), Elvitegravir(EVG), Dolutagravir (DTG), Bictegravir (BIC), cabotagravir (CAB), Lenacapavir (LEN); CAI (Capsid Inhibitor), including GS-CA1, Lenacapavir (GS-6207)"
