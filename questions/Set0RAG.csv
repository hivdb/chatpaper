2102,Does the paper report GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates other than those for laboratory HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Genbank,,Boolean,"If the sequences were submitted to GenBank, the paper may have GenBank accession numbers which are two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. GenBank accession numbers contain 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. We are not interested in the sequences or GenBank accession numbers of commonly used laboratory viruses such as HXB2 or NL43.","If the sequences have been submitted to GenBank, the paper may contain GenBank accession numbers, consisting of two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. We do not require the sequences or GenBank accession numbers of commonly used laboratory viruses such as HXB2 or NL43.",yes
2202,Does the paper report lists of mutations for individual sequenced HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Mutation,Individual or one group,Boolean,The authors can indicate whether they submitted the samples to GenBank or the authors can provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. Lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence,"The authors have the option to indicate whether they have submitted the samples to GenBank, or they can alternatively provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. These lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence. If gene sequencing samples are not available on GenBank, then the author may provide a list of mutations in lieu of the actual sequences. That could be a complete or partial mutation list for each sampled sequence.",yes
2304,Does the paper report the results of HIV pol sequences?,Sequence information,"Species, subtype, gene",,Boolean,"The genes we are interested are (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid.  HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene. HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene","The genes in which we are interested include: (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid. HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene, while the HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene. The mention of any of the terms RT, PR, or IN implies that the paper reports the HIV pol sequences",yes
2605,Were sequences obtained from individuals with active HIV replication?,Sequence information,Sequence source,,Boolean,,"If the sequences have been isolated from plasma, this indicates active HIV replication. Similarly, if the patient has been newly diagnosed or is ART/treatment-naive, this suggests active HIV replication. Furthermore, if the patient has experienced virological failure, it is implied that HIV is actively replicating.",yes
4105,Does the study provide complete ART history information for all of the individuals in the study?,Treatment information,naive and experienced,Individual or a group,Boolean,,"Regimen history details should encompass the drugs used and their duration of use. If all the patients have been newly diagnosed or are treatment/ART naive, the complete ART history is classified as 'naive'.",yes
4305,Were the individuals in the study INSTI-naive?,Treatment information,Drug class,,Boolean,Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition ART-naive.,"The drug classes of ARV treatments include PI, NRTI, NNRTI, INSTI, and CAI. Patients who receive none of these ARV treatments are considered ART-naive. This inherently applies to newly-diagnosed patients, as their recent diagnosis suggests they have not yet initiated treatment. Patients who receive any of these ARV treatments are deemed ART-experienced. Patients commonly receive a combination of ARV treatments, although not always all possible options. Thus, they are considered experienced in the treatments they have received and naive in those they have not. For example, an individual who has received a regimen containing NRTI, NNRTI, and PI but lacks INSTI treatment is considered ART-experienced, while also being categorized as INSTI-naive and CAI-naive.",yes
4405,Did all individuals receive the same number of ART regimens?,Treatment information,Regimen,,Boolean,,"The number of regimens a patient receives is determined by the number of distinct treatment periods they have undergone. Patients who are ART-naive have been administered 0 regimens. Patients who have only initiated their first line of ART have been administered 1 regimen. Patients who have changed their combination of ART treatments will possess more than 1 regimen, depending on the number of times their combination of ART treatments has changed.",yes
