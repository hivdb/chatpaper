2102,Does the paper report GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates other than those for laboratory HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Genbank,,Boolean,"If the sequences were submitted to GenBank, the paper may have GenBank accession numbers which are two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. GenBank accession numbers contain 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. We are not interested in the sequences or GenBank accession numbers of commonly used laboratory viruses such as HXB2 or NL43.",,yes
2202,Does the paper report lists of mutations for individual sequenced HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Mutation,Individual or one group,Boolean,The authors can indicate whether they submitted the samples to GenBank or the authors can provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. Lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence,,yes
2304,Does the paper report the results of HIV pol sequences?,Sequence information,"Species, subtype, gene",,Boolean,"The genes we are interested are (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid.  HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene. HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene",,yes
2502,Was sequencing performed using Sanger sequencing?,,,,Boolean,Sanger (aka dideoxyterminator or dideoxynucleotide) sequencing was the only method used prior to 2007. Companies involved in Sanger sequencing included ABI (ViroSeq) and Visible Genetics (TruGene). ,,yes
2603,How many samples in the paper were reported to have undergone plasma virus sequencing?,,,,Numerical,"It is important to know whether a sample contains just plasma or just PBMCs. Rarely samples are obtained from specific types of lymphocytes (which are a subset of PBMCs), lymph nodes, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ",,yes
2605,Were sequences obtained from individuals with active HIV replication?,,,,Boolean,"In patients with active virus replication, DRMs detected by HIV PBMC sequencing are usually similar to those detected by plasma HIV sequencing.",,yes
4105,Does the study provide complete ART history information for all of the individuals in the study?,,,,Boolean,,,
4301,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study?,,,,Categorical,"There are about 30 FDA-approved ARVs. The most commonly used are: (1) the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), including the cytosine analogs lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC), the tenofovir prodrugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and zidovudine (AZT or ZDV) and abacavir (ABC); (2) the nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), rilpivirine (RPV), etravirine (ETR), and doravirine (DOR); (3) the pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), including ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV; LPV/r) and ritonavir- or cobicistat boosted atazanavir (ATV; ATV/r or ATV/c) and darunavir (DRV; DRV/r or DRV/c); and (4) the first-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) raltegravir and elvitegravir, and the second-generation INSTIs dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BA), and cabotegravir (CAB). There are 4 FDA approved entry inhibitors. There is 1 FDA approved capsid (CA) inhibitor (CAI) lenacapavir.",,yes
4303,Does the paper report information on individuals who received protease inhibitors?,,,,Boolean,"the pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), including ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV; LPV/r) and ritonavir- or cobicistat boosted atazanavir (ATV; ATV/r or ATV/c) and darunavir (DRV; DRV/r or DRV/c); ",,yes
4304,Did all of the individuals in the paper receive the same ART?,,,,Boolean,,,
4305,Were the individuals in the study INSTI-naive?,Treatment information,Drug class,,Boolean,Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition ART-naive.,,yes
