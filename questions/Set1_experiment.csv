2304,Does the paper report the results of HIV pol sequences?,Sequence information,"Species, subtype, gene",,Boolean,,"The genes in which we are interested include: (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid. HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene, while the HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene. The mention of any of the terms RT, PR, or IN implies that the paper reports the HIV pol sequences",yes
4105,Does the paper provide complete ART history for all of the individuals in the study?,Treatment information,naive and experienced,Individual or a group,Boolean,,"Regimen history details should encompass the drugs used and their duration of use. If all the patients have been newly diagnosed or are treatment/ART naive, the complete ART history is classified as 'naive'.",yes
2202,Does the paper report lists of mutations for individual sequenced HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Mutation,Individual or one group,Boolean,,"The authors can indicate whether they submitted the samples to GenBank or the authors can provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. Lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence. If gene sequencing samples are not available with GenBank accession number, then the author may provide a list of mutations as a substitute. We need a complete mutation list for each sequence obtained from samples.",yes
4305,Were the individuals in the paper INSTI-naive?,Treatment information,Drug class,,Boolean,,"The first-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) raltegravir and elvitegravir, and the second-generation INSTIs dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BA), and cabotegravir (CAB). If the patients were newly treated they were both ART-naive and INSTI-naive.",yes
4405,Did all individuals in the paper receive the same number of ART regimens?,Treatment information,Regimen,,Boolean,,"The number of regimens a patient receives is determined by the number of distinct ART-treatment  they have received. Patients who are ART-naive have been administered 0 regimens. Patients who have only initiated their first line of ART have been administered 1 regimen. Patients who have changed their combination of ART treatments will possess more than 1 regimen, depending on the number of times the ART treatments had changed.",yes
2605,Were sequences in the paper obtained from individuals with active HIV replication?,Sequence information,Sequence source,,Boolean,,"If the sequences have been isolated from plasma, this indicates active HIV replication. Similarly, if the patient has been newly diagnosed or is ART/treatment-naive, this suggests active HIV replication. Furthermore, if the patient has experienced virological failure, that implied that HIV is actively replicating.",yes
4301,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the paper?,Treatment information,Drug class,Before or After genotyping,Categorical,,"There are about 30 FDA-approved ARVs. The most commonly used are: (1) the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), including the cytosine analogs lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC), the tenofovir prodrugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and zidovudine (AZT or ZDV) and abacavir (ABC); (2) the nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), rilpivirine (RPV), etravirine (ETR), and doravirine (DOR); (3) the pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), including ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV; LPV/r) and ritonavir- or cobicistat boosted atazanavir (ATV; ATV/r or ATV/c) and darunavir (DRV; DRV/r or DRV/c); and (4) the first-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) raltegravir and elvitegravir, and the second-generation INSTIs dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BA), and cabotegravir (CAB). There are 4 FDA approved entry inhibitors. There is 1 FDA approved capsid (CA) inhibitor (CAI) lenacapavir.",yes
