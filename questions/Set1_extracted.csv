1104,Does the paper report in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility data?,paper category,,Boolean,"In vitro susceptibility testing (aka phenotypic testing) of viruses with drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) to determine the concentration required to inhibit the replication of these viruses by 50% (referred to as EC50 or IC50). This concentration is divided by the EC50 (or IC50) of a reference drug-susceptible virus to determine the fold-reduction in susceptibility (aka fold increase in drug resistance) of a virus to an ARV
Phenotypic testing is usually performed on site-directed mutants, virus isolates that developed mutations during in vitro passage experiments, or on clinical viruses samples obtained directly from a patient sample. If phenotypic testing was performed, there are usually one or more sentences describing the phenotypic test method. The most common method is the PhenoSense assay (which can also be referred to as PhenoSenseGT).",
2503,Was sequencing in the paper performed using an NGS technology?,Sequence information,Sequencing method,Boolean,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is being increasingly used but is still less common than Sanger sequencing. The main NGS methods involve using Illumina, Nanopore, Ion Torrent, and PacBio.
If NGS was performed, the authors may report the number of sequence reads obtained for the sequenced sample. If NGS was performed, the authors may report the proportion of reads containing a mutation.",
2504,Were samples in the paper cloned prior to sequencing?,Sequence information,Sequencing method,Boolean,"Virus samples may also be cloned prior to sequencing. Molecular cloning involves ligating the virus genes of interest into a plasmid and transforming bacteria with the plasmid. Studies in which HIV was cloned prior to sequencing usually contain several additional sentences describing this process. Another method of cloning, called single genome sequencing (SGS) or single genome amplification (SGA) involves limiting dilution analysis of reverse-transcribed virus RNA (also known as complementary DNA or cDNA).",
2601,Does the paper report the results of plasma HIV sequencing?,Sequence information,Sequence source,Boolean,"We are collecting the following information about HIV isolates: (1) Whether they are obtained from (1) plasma samples, (2) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), (3) dried blood spots, (4) or whole blood. Dried blood spots and whole blood contain both plasma and PBMCs. It is important to know whether a sample contains just plasma or just PBMCs. Rarely samples are obtained from specific types of lymphocytes (which are a subset of PBMCs), lymph nodes, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Plasma HIV nucleic acids contain just RNA. PBMC HIV nucleic acids contain just DNA.",
2602,Does the paper report the results of PBMC HIV sequencing?,Sequence information,Sequence source,Boolean,"We are collecting the following information about HIV isolates: (1) Whether they are obtained from (1) plasma samples, (2) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), (3) dried blood spots, (4) or whole blood. Dried blood spots and whole blood contain both plasma and PBMCs. It is important to know whether a sample contains just plasma or just PBMCs.

2604,How many samples in the paper were reported to have undergone PBMC virus sequencing?,Sequence information,Sequence source,Numerical,"We are collecting the following information about HIV isolates: (1) Whether they are obtained from (1) plasma samples, (2) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), (3) dried blood spots, (4) or whole blood.

2703,Were all of the individuals in the paper in a clinical trial?,Sequence information,Individual characteristics,Boolean,It is often useful to know if the patients in a study were part of a clinical trial because in such studies the ART histories of the patients are more likely to be less heterogeneous.,
4102,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Treatment information,naive and experienced,Boolean,"Important information from a paper regarding treatment would include (1) How many patients received ART (ART-experienced) and how many had not (i.e., were ART-naive); (2) How many ART-experienced patients received an ARV belonging to specific ARV classes; (3) Which drugs in each drug class were received among ART-experienced patients; and (4) How many ART regimens were received by a patient (i.e., the patient's ART history). It is important to know whether a patient received just a single ARV in a drug class because in that case, it is likely that the DRMs associated with the drug class were selected by the ARV the patient had received. It is important to know whether the ART history of a patient was complete. If the ART history is not complete, it is useful to know which ARVs were definitely not received. For example, it may be known that a patient received an INSTI but did not receive a second-generation INSTI. Sometimes information will only be presented about the type of regimen received. For example, a patient in a LMIC who received a first-line regimen, would have received 2 NRTIs and an NNRTI. The NRTIs would include either 3TC or FTC and either TFV or AZT (less likely D4T or ABC). The NNRTIs would include NVP or EFV. The ART history from a patient in a LMIC receiving a second-line regimen would have received a first-line regimen followed by a second-line regimen containing a PI (most commonly LPV/r) plus 2 NRTIs. In many studies, there are patients with different ART histories. The information linking a patient identifier to their ART history may be found in a table or in the supplementary material of a paper. These data may be necessary to link the mutations in an HIV sequence to the ART history of the patient from whom the sequence was obtained.",
