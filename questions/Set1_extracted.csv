2102,Does the paper report GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates other than those for laboratory HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Genbank,,Boolean,"If the sequences were submitted to GenBank, the paper may have GenBank accession numbers  which are two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. GenBank accession numbers contain 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. We are not interested in the sequences or GenBank accession numbers of commonly used laboratory viruses such as HXB2 or NL43.",Yes
4301,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the paper?,Treatment information,Drug class,Before or After genotyping,Categorical,"There are about 30 FDA-approved ARVs. The most commonly used are: (1) the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), including the cytosine analogs lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC), the tenofovir prodrugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and zidovudine (AZT or ZDV) and abacavir (ABC); (2) the nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), rilpivirine (RPV), etravirine (ETR), and doravirine (DOR); (3) the pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), including ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV; LPV/r) and ritonavir- or cobicistat boosted atazanavir (ATV; ATV/r or ATV/c) and darunavir (DRV; DRV/r or DRV/c); and (4) the first-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) raltegravir and elvitegravir, and the second-generation INSTIs dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BA), and cabotegravir (CAB). There are 4 FDA approved entry inhibitors. There is 1 FDA approved capsid (CA) inhibitor (CAI) lenacapavir.

 The most commonly used ART regimens include 2 NRTIs plus either an NNRTI, a PI, or an INSTI. Since about 2010, the most commonly used NRTIs have included either 3TC or FTC (sometimes collectively referred to as XTC) and TDF or TAF (sometimes collectively referred to as TFV or TXF). AZT and ABC are occasionally used with 3TC. Prior to 2010, another NRTI stavudine (D4T) was often used with 3TC in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In the early 2000s, most first-line ART regimens in both LMICs and upper-Income countries (UICs) consisted of 2 NRTIs plus an NNRTI, most commonly NVP or EFV. For the past 5 years, 2 NRTIs plus the INSTI DTG have been recommended for first-line ART in LMICs. For the past 10 years, 2 NRTIs plus an INSTI have been recommended for first-line ART in UICs. Currently, the following INSTIs are recommended for first-line ART in UICs: DTG + 2 NRTIs, BIC + 2 NRTIs, and DTG + 3TC. ",Yes
2605,Were sequences in the paper obtained from individuals with active HIV replication?,Sequence information,Sequence source,,Boolean,"In patients with active virus replication, DRMs detected by HIV PBMC sequencing are usually similar to those detected by plasma HIV sequencing.",Yes
2502,Was sequencing in the paper performed using Sanger sequencing?,Sequence information,Sequencing method,,Boolean,Sanger (aka dideoxyterminator or dideoxynucleotide) sequencing was the only method used prior to 2007. Companies involved in Sanger sequencing included ABI (ViroSeq) and Visible Genetics (TruGene). ,Yes
2603,How many samples in the paper were reported to have undergone plasma virus sequencing?,Sequence information,Sequence source,Before/After ART,Numerical,"It is important to know whether a sample contains just plasma or just PBMCs. Patients whose virus levels in plasma (aka virus load) are suppressed are defined as having essentially no detectable virus in plasma (most commonly <50 HIV RNA copies per ml). In patients with active virus replication, DRMs detected by HIV PBMC sequencing are usually similar to those detected by plasma HIV sequencing. Rarely samples are obtained from specific types of lymphocytes (which are a subset of PBMCs), lymph nodes, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",Yes
4105,Does the paper provide complete ART history for all of the individuals in the study?,Treatment information,naive and experienced,Individual or a group,Boolean,"Important information from a paper regarding treatment would include (1) How many patients received ART (ART-experienced) and how many had not (i.e., were ART-naive); (2) How many ART-experienced patients received an ARV belonging to specific ARV classes; (3) Which drugs in each drug class were received among ART-experienced patients; and (4) How many ART regimens were received by a patient (i.e., the patient's ART history). It is important to know whether a patient received just a single ARV in a drug class because in that case, it is likely that the DRMs associated with the drug class were selected by the ARV the patient had received. It is important to know whether the ART history of a patient was complete. If the ART history is not complete, it is useful to know which ARVs were definitely not received. For example, it may be known that a patient received an INSTI but did not receive a second-generation INSTI. Sometimes information will only be presented about the type of regimen received. For example, a patient in a LMIC who received a first-line regimen, would have received 2 NRTIs and an NNRTI. The NRTIs would include either 3TC or FTC and either TFV or AZT (less likely D4T or ABC). The NNRTIs would include NVP or EFV. The ART history from a patient in a LMIC receiving a second-line regimen would have received a first-line regimen followed by a second-line regimen containing a PI (most commonly LPV/r) plus 2 NRTIs.",Yes
