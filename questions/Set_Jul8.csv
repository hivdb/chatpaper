C.	Other
D.	Not reported"
5,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Select one or many of  the following options and begin your answer with this:
A.	Protease, PR
B.	Reverse transcriptase, RT

"
6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Try your best to get countries from abstract, method, or result section. If no sequenced samples were used in this research paper, you should return ""Not Found""."
7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Reply with a list of year(s) only. If no sequenced samples were used in this research paper, you should return ""Not Found""."
8,What method was used for sequencing?,"Sequencing is performed using two main types of methods. Sanger (aka dideoxyterminator or dideoxynucleotide) sequencing was the only method used prior to 2007. Companies involved in Sanger sequencing included ABI (ViroSeq) and Visible Genetics (TruGene). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is being increasingly used but is still less common than Sanger sequencing. The main NGS methods involve using Illumina, Nanopore, Ion Torrent, and PacBio. Genotypic resistance testing refers to sequencing of the genes that are the targets of ART. This usually refers to the RT, protease, and integrase genes.


Select from the following options and begin your answer with this:
A.	Sanger sequencing
B.	Illumina sequencing
C.	PacBio sequencing
D.	Oxford Nanopore sequencing
E. 	Unknown
F.	Other"
9,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or  'No' as the first word. If the information is not mentioned in the provided paper, then the answer is ""No"""
10,Did samples undergo single genome sequencing?,"Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or  'No' as the first word. If not mentioned in paper, then the answer is ""No"""
