2102,Does the paper report GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates other than those for laboratory HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Genbank,,Boolean,"If the sequences were submitted to GenBank, the paper may have GenBank accession numbers which are two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. GenBank accession numbers contain 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. We are not interested in the sequences or GenBank accession numbers of commonly used laboratory viruses such as HXB2 or NL43.",,yes
2202,Does the paper report lists of mutations for individual sequenced HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Mutation,Individual or one group,Boolean,The authors can indicate whether they submitted the samples to GenBank or the authors can provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. Lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence,"The authors can indicate whether they submitted the samples to GenBank or the authors can provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. Lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence. Molecular epidemiology studies also provided list of mutations but not for individual isolates, and always show the percentage among all sequences.",yes
2304,Does the paper report the results of HIV pol sequences?,Sequence information,"Species, subtype, gene",,Boolean,"The genes we are interested are (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid.  HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene. HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene","The genes we are interested are (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid.  HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene. HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene. When any of RT, PR, IN was mentioned, that means the paper report the HIV pol sequences",yes
2605,Were sequences obtained from individuals with active HIV replication?,Sequence information,Sequence source,,Boolean,,"If the sequences were isolated from plasma, that means the HIV was actively replicated. If the patient was newly diagnosed or ART/treatment naive, that means the the HIV was actively replicated. If the patient met virological failure, that means  the HIV was actively replicated.",yes
4105,Does the study provide complete ART history information for all of the individuals in the study?,Treatment information,naive and experienced,Individual or a group,Boolean,,"If all the patients were newly diagnosed or treatment/ART naive, the complete ART history is ""naive"".",yes
4305,Were the individuals in the study INSTI-naive?,Treatment information,Drug class,,Boolean,Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition ART-naive.,"Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition treatment-naive. If the patients were treatment-naive, that means they were INSTI-naive. If the patients got treatment, but the treatment didn't include INSTI drugs, that means they were INSTI-naive",yes
4405,Did all individuals receive the same number of ART regimens?,Treatment information,Regimen,,Boolean,,"Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition ART-naive. If patients were all naive, that means they received the same number of ART regimen. If all patients received first-line treatment only, they received the same number of ART regimen. If all patients received both first-line and second-line treatment, they received the same number of ART regimen. ",yes
4406,Did all individuals receive one ART regimen?,Treatment information,Regimen,,Boolean,,"Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition ART-naive. If patients were all naive, that means they received zero ART regimen. If all patients received first-line treatment only, they received the one ART regimen. If all patients received first-line and second-line treatment, they received the two ART regimens. ",no
