2102,Does the paper report GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates other than those for laboratory HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Genbank,,Boolean,"If the sequences were submitted to GenBank, the paper may have GenBank accession numbers which are two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. GenBank accession numbers contain 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. We are not interested in the sequences or GenBank accession numbers of commonly used laboratory viruses such as HXB2 or NL43.","If the sequences were submitted to GenBank, the paper may have GenBank accession numbers which are two letters followed by six numbers. The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) share their data with GenBank. GenBank accession numbers contain 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. Patient HIV isolate sequences are typically compared against a set of Laboratory HIV isolates, which are previously-obtained sequences prior to the study in question. By comparing patient sequences from laboratory sequences, researchers are able to generate a list of sequence mutations. Common laboratory sequences include [provide commonly used isolate genbank numbers]. We are not interested in collecting GenBank numbers for laboratory HIV isolates.",yes
2202,Does the paper report lists of mutations for individual sequenced HIV isolates?,Sequence information,Mutation,Individual or one group,Boolean,The authors can indicate whether they submitted the samples to GenBank or the authors can provide lists of amino acid mutations present in sequenced virus samples. Lists of mutations are presented as amino acid differences from a reference sequence,"If gene sequencing samples are not available on GenBank, then the author may provide a list of mutations as a substitute. We will need a complete mutation list for each sequence obtained from samples. ",yes
2304,Does the paper report the results of HIV pol sequences?,Sequence information,"Species, subtype, gene",,Boolean,"The genes we are interested are (1) reverse transcriptase (RT), (2) protease (PR), (3) integrase (IN or INT), and (4) capsid.  HIV RT, protease, and integrase are encoded by the HIV pol gene. HIV capsid is encoded by the HIV gag gene","We are interested in studies that report gene sequencing data. The primary gene regions that are subject to sequencing are gag and pol. The sub-regions of interest within pol are reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and integrase (IN or INT). The sub-region of interest within gag sequences is capsid.",yes
2605,Were sequences obtained from individuals with active HIV replication?,Sequence information,Sequence source,,Boolean,,"If the sequences were isolated from plasma, that means the HIV was actively replicated. If the patient was newly diagnosed or ART/treatment naive, that means the the HIV was actively replicated. If the patient met virological failure, that means the HIV was actively replicated.",yes
4105,Does the study provide complete ART history information for all of the individuals in the study?,Treatment information,naive and experienced,Individual or a group,Boolean,,Regimen history details include drugs used and their duration of use. ART-naive patients are considered to have a known ART history because it is known that they have had no drugs. ,yes
4305,Were the individuals in the study INSTI-naive?,Treatment information,Drug class,,Boolean,Patients who are newly diagnosed are by definition ART-naive.,"The set of ART treatments consists of PI, NRTI, NNRTI, INSTI, and CAI treatments. Patients that receive none of the ART treatments (PI, NRTI, NNRTI, INSTI, nor CAI) are considered ART-naive. By definition, this includes newly-diagnosed patients, as their recent diagnosis implies they have not initiated treatment yet. Patients that receive any of the the ART treatments (PI, NRTI, NNRTI, INSTI, and/or CAI) are considered ART-experienced. Patients usually receive a combination of the ART treatments, but not all treatments. In these cases, these patients are experienced for the treatments they receive, and are naive for the treatments they have not received. For example, someone who has received a regimen containing NRTI, NNRTI, and PI but did not receive INSTI are considered ART-experienced while also being considered INSTI-naive and CAI-naive. ",yes
4405,Did all individuals receive the same number of ART regimens?,Treatment information,Regimen,,Boolean,,"The number of regimens that a patient receives is defined by the number of distinct combinations of treatments they received at a given time. Patients that ART-naive have had 0 regimens. Patients that have only initiated their first line of ART have had 1 regimen. Patients that have changed their combination of ART treatments will have more than 1 regimen, depending on the number of times their combination of ART treatments have changed. ",yes
